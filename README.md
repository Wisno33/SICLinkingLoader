# SICLinkingLoader
A two pass linker and loader for the SIC and SICXE architecture.

This linking loader operates in two passes. The first takes the input file and creates a external reference table for linking purposes, this can be seen as the linking step. In the second pass the linked object code is loaded in at the provided address. Once completed a txt file representing the memory of the machine is output. The memory is zeroed out in all addresses except where the program is loaded.
